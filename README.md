# Getting And Cleaning Data - Assignment
## Description
This is the repository for the Assignment of the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

In this assignment, you should write an R script, that converts a dataset into a tidy dataset.

A dataset is said to be tidy if it satisfies the following conditions

1. observations are in rows
2. variables are in columns
3. contained in a single dataset.

The source data is found here: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

In the script, it is assumed that the data is in a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" on the same level as this repository. If not the path could be set with the "pathtodata" variable.
